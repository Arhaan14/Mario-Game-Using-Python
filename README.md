# Mario-Game-Using-Python
It is a fully functional Mario game made using Python only.
The Mario game made using Python is a fully functional game that is based on the classic Super Mario Bros. game. The game is built using Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. The game consists of several levels that the player must complete by controlling Mario and navigating through obstacles such as enemies, pits, and blocks.

The game has been developed to be fully functional, meaning that all aspects of the game such as movement, collision detection, and scoring, work correctly. The player controls Mario using the arrow keys and can jump, run, and collect power-ups such as mushrooms and fire flowers. The game also includes sound effects and music to enhance the player's experience.

The development of the game required a combination of programming skills such as game physics, animation, and user interface design. The game features a score system, with points awarded for collecting coins and defeating enemies. Players can also save their progress in the game and load their saved game later.

Overall, the fully functional Mario game made using Python is a great example of how Python can be used to develop complex games with interactive features. It demonstrates the power of Python and Pygame for game development and provides a fun and engaging experience for players.
